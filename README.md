## Intro

Octopus game is a crypto NFT game.

Using small token to get in, earn the biggest reward for fun.



Each game player transfer at least 500 OCGT(Octopus Game Token) to the game pool, picking the Color(1 in 3) and Lucky Number(LN)(1 in 10).

When the game start, it will randomly generate the game color and lucky number in Chainlink. Right Color but wrong LN players can get back half OCGT of their pay in this game. Right LN but wrong Color players can get back double OCGT of their pay in this game.

And the players who get the right color and right LN at the same time are the winning group, they will split the game pool.

Another thing. One in the winner group will receive an extra bonus, a winner crown NFT that is rare and epic. Most 52 per year all over the world (every week a game).

In the future, the game will add more levels and more combinations.
